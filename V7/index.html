      <h2>What is hogwarts?</h2>
      <p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry boarding school of magic for
        students aged eleven to eighteen of the Wizarding World.
      </p>
      <h3>Academics and traditions</h3>
      <p>
        Hogwarts is a coeducational, secondary boarding school, taking children
        from ages eleven to eighteen, in line with real-world combined
        secondary and sixth form institutions in Britain. Education at Hogwarts
        is not compulsory, with some students being home schooled.
        There are about one thousand students at Hogwarts.
      </p>
      <h3>Establishment</h3>
      <p>
        Founded around the 9th century and 10th century by Godric Gryffindor,
        Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin, Hogwarts was
        established in the Highlands of Scotland to educate young wizards and
        witches as well as to keep students safe from Muggle persecution.
        Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts after
        dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake. Since then,
        Hogwarts educated most wizarding children with residence in Great Britain and
        Ireland, keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and Muggles.
      </p>
      <h3>Middle Ages</h3>
      <p>
        About 300 years after the school was founded, the
        Triwizard Tournament was established as an interscholastic
        competition among the three most prestigious magical
        schools in Europe: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang.
        The tournament continued for six centuries before being discontinued.
        An attempt was made in the 1994-1995 school year to revive the
        tournament, but the consequential death of Cedric Diggory resulted
        in its permanent discontinuation.
      </p>
      <h3>Arrival</h3>
      <p>The primary mode of transport to Hogwarts is the
        Hogwarts Express that students take at the start of each school year.
        Students board the train from the
        hidden Platform 9Â¾ at King's Cross station in London.
        The train arrives at Hogsmeade station near Hogwarts, sometime after nightfall.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, first-year students are accompanied by the
        "Keeper of the Keys, Game and Grounds"
        to small boats, which magically sail across the lake and get them near the entrance of Hogwarts.
        The older students ride up to the castle in carriages pulled by creatures called Thestrals.
        When the first-year students initially arrive at the castle, they wait in a small
        chamber off the entrance hall until the older students have taken
        their seats, and then enter the Great Hall for the Sorting Ceremony to
        determine their House assignments.
      </p>

      <h3>Houses</h3>
      <p>Hogwarts is divided into four houses, each bearing the last
        name of its founder: Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin,
        Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff.
        Throughout the school year, the houses compete for
        the House Cup, gaining and losing points based on actions
        such as performance in class and rule violations.
        The house with the highest end-of-year total wins and
        has its colours displayed in the Great Hall for the following school year.
        Each house also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Quidditch Cup.
        These two competitions breed rivalries between the houses.
        Houses at Hogwarts are living and learning communities for their students.
        Each house is under the authority of one of the Hogwarts staff members.
        The Heads of the houses, as they are called, are in charge of giving their
        students important information, dealing with matters of severe punishment,
        and responding to emergencies in their houses, among other things.
        The dormitory and common room of a House are, barring rare exceptions,
        inaccessible to students belonging to other Houses; however, different
        houses will share classes as they are based on year group rather than House.
