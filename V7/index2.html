      <h2>Hogsmeade</h2>
      <p>Hogsmeade Village, or simply called Hogsmeade, was the only all-wizarding village in Britain. It was founded by
        Hengist of Woodcroft. Since before 1714 (when the 1714 Edict was passed), Hogwarts third-years and above had
        been permitted weekend trips into the village.
        Mainly, students frequented the High Street in the village, which contained the named speciality shops and pubs
        such as Zonko's Joke Shop and Honeydukes. Otherwise, they wandered on to observe the infamous Shrieking Shack.
        Hogsmeade was a picturesque little village of cottages and shops, with enchanted candles hanging in the trees
        during the holidays. It was also near the location of the train station used by the Hogwarts Express.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>The Forbidden Forest</h2>
      <p>The Forbidden Forest was an ominous wooded area, situated on the edges of Hogwarts but out-of-bound to its
        students. Full of magical creatures and beings, including unicorns, Acromantula, Thestrals and centaurs, the
        forest was known as a dangerous place for all - except perhaps the keeper of keys</p>
